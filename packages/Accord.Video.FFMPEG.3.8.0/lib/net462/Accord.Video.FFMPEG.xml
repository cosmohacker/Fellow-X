 Check if context can be reused, otherwise reallocate a new one.

 If context is NULL, just calls sws_getContext() to get a new
 context. Otherwise, checks if the parameters are the ones already
 saved in context. If that is the case, returns the current
 context. Otherwise, frees context and gets a new context with
 the new parameters.

 Be warned that srcFilter and dstFilter are not checked, they
 are assumed to remain the same.

 Guess the sample aspect ratio of a frame, based on both the stream and the

 Since the frame aspect ratio is set by the codec but the stream aspect ratio
 is set by the demuxer, these two may not be equal. This function tries to
 return the value that you should use if you would like to display the frame.

 Basic logic is to use the stream aspect ratio if it is set to something sane
 otherwise use the frame aspect ratio. This way a container setting, which is
 usually easy to modify can override the coded value in the frames.

Lock operation used by lockmgr


 Register a user provided lock manager supporting the operations
 specified by AVLockOp. The "mutex" argument to the function points
 to a (void *) where the lockmgr should store/get a pointer to a user
 allocated mutex. It is NULL upon AV_LOCK_CREATE and equal to the
 value left by the last call for all other ops. If the lock manager is
 unable to perform the op then it should leave the mutex in the same
 state as when it was called and return a non-zero value. However,
 when called with AV_LOCK_DESTROY the mutex will always be assumed to
 have been successfully destroyed. If av_lockmgr_register succeeds
 it will return a non-negative value, if it fails it will return a
 negative value and destroy all mutex and unregister all callbacks.
 av_lockmgr_register is not thread-safe, it must be called from a
 single thread before any calls which make use of locking are used.

 @param cb User defined callback. av_lockmgr_register invokes calls
           to this callback and the previously registered callback.
           The callback will be used to create more than one mutex

           mechanism (i.e. do not use a single static object to

 a packet with av_bsf_send_packet(), this function needs to be called

 side data must be present in pkt). The bitstream filter will take ownership of
 the packet and reset the contents of pkt. pkt is not touched if an error occurs.
 This parameter may be NULL, which signals the end of the stream (i.e. no more

 *poutbuf was set it points to the input buffer (not necessarily to
 its starting address). A special case is if *poutbuf was set to NULL and
 *poutbuf_size was set to 0, which indicates the packet should be dropped.

 If no subtitle could be decompressed, got_sub_ptr is zero.
 Otherwise, the subtitle is stored in *sub.
 Note that AV_CODEC_CAP_DR1 is not available for subtitle codecs. This is for
 simplicity, because the performance difference is expect to be negligible
 and reusing a get_buffer written for video codecs would probably perform badly
 due to a potentially very different allocation pattern.

 Some decoders (those marked with CODEC_CAP_DELAY) have a delay between input
 and output. This means that for some packets they will not immediately
 produce decoded output and need to be flushed at the end of decoding to get
 all the decoded data. Flushing is done by calling this function with packets
 with avpkt-&gt;data set to NULL and avpkt-&gt;size set to 0 until it stops
 returning subtitles. It is safe to flush even those decoders that are not

 * Decode the audio frame of size avpkt-&gt;size from avpkt-&gt;data into frame.
 *
 * Some decoders may support multiple frames in a single AVPacket. Such
 * decoders would then just decode the first frame and the return value would be
 * less than the packet size. In this case, avcodec_decode_audio4 has to be
 * called again with an AVPacket containing the remaining data in order to
 * decode the second frame, etc...  Even if no frames are returned, the packet
 * needs to be fed to the decoder with remaining data until it is completely
 * consumed or an error occurs.
 *
 * Some decoders (those marked with AV_CODEC_CAP_DELAY) have a delay between input
 * and output. This means that for some packets they will not immediately
 * produce decoded output and need to be flushed at the end of decoding to get
 * all the decoded data. Flushing is done by calling this function with packets
 * with avpkt-&gt;data set to NULL and avpkt-&gt;size set to 0 until it stops
 * returning samples. It is safe to flush even those decoders that are not
 * marked with AV_CODEC_CAP_DELAY, then no samples will be returned.
 *
 * @warning The input buffer, avpkt-&gt;data must be AV_INPUT_BUFFER_PADDING_SIZE
 *          larger than the actual read bytes because some optimized bitstream
 *          readers read 32 or 64 bits at once and could read over the end.
 *
 * @note The AVCodecContext MUST have been opened with @ref avcodec_open2()
 * before packets may be fed to the decoder.
 *
 * @param      avctx the codec context
 * @param[out] frame The AVFrame in which to store decoded audio samples.
 *                   The decoder will allocate a buffer for the decoded frame by
 *                   calling the AVCodecContext.get_buffer2() callback.
 *                   When AVCodecContext.refcounted_frames is set to 1, the frame is
 *                   reference counted and the returned reference belongs to the
 *                   caller. The caller must release the frame using av_frame_unref()
 *                   when the frame is no longer needed. The caller may safely write
 *                   to the frame if av_frame_is_writable() returns 1.
 *                   When AVCodecContext.refcounted_frames is set to 0, the returned
 *                   reference belongs to the decoder and is valid only until the
 *                   next call to this function or until closing or flushing the
 *                   decoder. The caller may not write to it.
 * @param[out] got_frame_ptr Zero if no frame could be decoded, otherwise it is
 *                           non-zero. Note that this field being set to zero
 *                           does not mean that an error has occurred. For
 *                           decoders with AV_CODEC_CAP_DELAY set, no given decode
 *                           call is guaranteed to produce a frame.
 * @param[in]  avpkt The input AVPacket containing the input buffer.
 *                   At least avpkt-&gt;data and avpkt-&gt;size should be set. Some
 *                   decoders might also require additional fields to be set.

        <member name="F:libffmpeg.AVCodecContext.ticks_per_frame">
 For some codecs, the time base is closer to the field rate than the frame rate.
 Most notably, H.264 and MPEG-2 specify time_base as half of frame duration

        <member name="F:libffmpeg.AVCodecContext.time_base">
 This is the fundamental unit of time (in seconds) in terms
 of which frame timestamps are represented. For fixed-fps content,
 timebase should be 1/framerate and timestamp increments should be
 identically 1.
 This often, but not always is the inverse of the frame rate or field rate
 for video. 1/time_base is not the average frame rate if the frame rate is not
 constant.

 Like containers, elementary streams also can store timestamps, 1/time_base
 is the unit in which these timestamps are specified.
 As example of such codec time base see ISO/IEC 14496-2:2001(E)

Please use AVOptions (av_opt* / av_set/get*()) to access these fields from user
applications.
The name string for AVOptions options matches the associated command line

If non NULL, 'draw_horiz_band' is called by the libavcodec
decoder to draw a horizontal band. It improves cache usage. Not
all codecs can do that. You must check the codec capabilities
beforehand.
When multithreading is used, it may be called from multiple threads
at the same time; threads might draw different parts of the same AVFrame,
or multiple AVFrames, and there is no guarantee that slices will be drawn
in order.
The function is also used by hardware acceleration APIs.
It is called at least once during frame decoding to pass
the data needed for hardware render.
In that mode instead of pixel data, AVFrame points to
a structure specific to the acceleration API. The application
reads the structure and can change some fields to indicate progress
or mark state.

 This callback is called at the beginning of each frame to get data
 buffer(s) for it. There may be one contiguous buffer for all the data or
 there may be a buffer per each data plane or anything in between. What
 this means is, you may set however many entries in buf[] you feel necessary.
 Each buffer must be reference-counted using the AVBuffer API (see description
 of buf[] below).

 The following fields will be set in the frame before this callback is
 called:
 - format
 - width, height (video only)
 - sample_rate, channel_layout, nb_samples (audio only)
 Their values may differ from the corresponding values in
 AVCodecContext. This callback must use the frame values, not the codec
 context values, to calculate the required buffer size.

 This callback must fill the following fields in the frame:
 - data[]
 - linesize[]
 - extended_data:
   * if the data is planar audio with more than 8 channels, then this
     callback must allocate and fill extended_data to contain all pointers
     to all data planes. data[] must hold as many pointers as it can.
     extended_data must be allocated with av_malloc() and will be freed in
     av_frame_unref().
   * otherwise extended_data must point to data
 - buf[] must contain one or more pointers to AVBufferRef structures. Each of
   the frame's data and extended_data pointers must be contained in these. That
   is, one AVBufferRef for each allocated chunk of memory, not necessarily one
   AVBufferRef per data[] entry. See: av_buffer_create(), av_buffer_alloc(),
   and av_buffer_ref().
 - extended_buf and nb_extended_buf must be allocated with av_malloc() by
   this callback and filled with the extra buffers if there are more
   buffers than buf[] can hold. extended_buf will be freed in
   av_frame_unref().

 If AV_CODEC_CAP_DR1 is not set then get_buffer2() must call
 avcodec_default_get_buffer2() instead of providing buffers allocated by
 some other means.

 Each data plane must be aligned to the maximum required by the target
 CPU.

 @see avcodec_default_get_buffer2()

 Video:

 If AV_GET_BUFFER_FLAG_REF is set in flags then the frame may be reused
 (read and/or written to if it is writable) later by libavcodec.

 avcodec_align_dimensions2() should be used to find the required width and
 height, as they normally need to be rounded up to the next multiple of 16.

 Some decoders do not support linesizes changing between frames.

 If frame multithreading is used and thread_safe_callbacks is set,
 this callback may be called from a different thread, but not from more
 than one at once. Does not need to be reentrant.

 @see avcodec_align_dimensions2()

 Audio:

 Decoders request a buffer of a particular size by setting
 AVFrame.nb_samples prior to calling get_buffer2(). The decoder may,
 however, utilize only part of the buffer by setting AVFrame.nb_samples
 to a smaller value in the output frame.

 As a convenience, av_samples_get_buffer_size() and
 av_samples_fill_arrays() in libavutil may be used by custom get_buffer2()
 functions to find the required data size and to fill data pointers and
 linesize. In AVFrame.linesize, only linesize[0] may be set for audio
 since all planes must be the same size.

        <member name="T:libffmpeg.AVPacket">
 This structure stores compressed data. It is typically exported by demuxers
 and then passed as input to decoders, or received as output from encoders and
 then passed to muxers.

 For video, it should typically contain one compressed frame. For audio it may
 contain several compressed frames. Encoders are allowed to output empty
 packets, with no compressed data, containing only side data
 (e.g. to update some stream parameters at the end of encoding).

 AVPacket is one of the few structs in FFmpeg, whose size is a part of public
 ABI. Thus it may be allocated on stack and no new fields can be added to it
 without libavcodec and libavformat major bump.

 The semantics of data ownership depends on the buf field.
 If it is set, the packet data is dynamically allocated and is
 valid indefinitely until a call to av_packet_unref() reduces the
 reference count to 0.

 If the buf field is not set av_packet_ref() would make a copy instead
 of increasing the reference count.

 The side data is always allocated with av_malloc(), copied by
 av_packet_ref() and freed by av_packet_unref().

 @defgroup lavc_encdec send/receive encoding and decoding API overview
 @{

 The avcodec_send_packet()/avcodec_receive_frame()/avcodec_send_frame()/
 avcodec_receive_packet() functions provide an encode/decode API, which
 decouples input and output.

 The API is very similar for encoding/decoding and audio/video, and works as
 follows:
 - Set up and open the AVCodecContext as usual.
 - Send valid input:
   - For decoding, call avcodec_send_packet() to give the decoder raw
     compressed data in an AVPacket.
   - For encoding, call avcodec_send_frame() to give the decoder an AVFrame
     containing uncompressed audio or video.
   In both cases, it is recommended that AVPackets and AVFrames are
   refcounted, or libavcodec might have to copy the input data. (libavformat
   always returns refcounted AVPackets, and av_frame_get_buffer() allocates
   refcounted AVFrames.)
 - Receive output in a loop. Periodically call one of the avcodec_receive_*()
   functions and process their output:
   - For decoding, call avcodec_receive_frame(). On success, it will return
     an AVFrame containing uncompressed audio or video data.
   - For encoding, call avcodec_receive_packet(). On success, it will return
     an AVPacket with a compressed frame.
   Repeat this call until it returns AVERROR(EAGAIN) or an error. The
   AVERROR(EAGAIN) return value means that new input data is required to
   return new output. In this case, continue with sending input. For each
   input frame/packet, the codec will typically return 1 output frame/packet,
   but it can also be 0 or more than 1.

 At the beginning of decoding or encoding, the codec might accept multiple
 input frames/packets without returning a frame, until its internal buffers
 are filled. This situation is handled transparently if you follow the steps
 outlined above.

 End of stream situations. These require "flushing" (aka draining) the codec,
 as the codec might buffer multiple frames or packets internally for
 performance or out of necessity (consider B-frames).
 This is handled as follows:
 - Instead of valid input, send NULL to the avcodec_send_packet() (decoding)
   or avcodec_send_frame() (encoding) functions. This will enter draining
   mode.
 - Call avcodec_receive_frame() (decoding) or avcodec_receive_packet()
   (encoding) in a loop until AVERROR_EOF is returned. The functions will
   not return AVERROR(EAGAIN), unless you forgot to enter draining mode.
 - Before decoding can be resumed again, the codec has to be reset with
   avcodec_flush_buffers().

 Using the API as outlined above is highly recommended. But it is also
 possible to call functions outside of this rigid schema. For example, you can
 call avcodec_send_packet() repeatedly without calling
 avcodec_receive_frame(). In this case, avcodec_send_packet() will succeed
 until the codec's internal buffer has been filled up (which is typically of
 size 1 per output frame, after initial input), and then reject input with
 AVERROR(EAGAIN). Once it starts rejecting input, you have no choice but to
 read at least some output.

 Not all codecs will follow a rigid and predictable dataflow; the only
 guarantee is that an AVERROR(EAGAIN) return value on a send/receive call on
 one end implies that a receive/send call on the other end will succeed. In
 general, no codec will permit unlimited buffering of input or output.

 This API replaces the following legacy functions:
 - avcodec_decode_video2() and avcodec_decode_audio4():
   Use avcodec_send_packet() to feed input to the decoder, then use
   avcodec_receive_frame() to receive decoded frames after each packet.
   Unlike with the old video decoding API, multiple frames might result from
   a packet. For audio, splitting the input packet into frames by partially
   decoding packets becomes transparent to the API user. You never need to
   feed an AVPacket to the API twice.
   Additionally, sending a flush/draining packet is required only once.
 - avcodec_encode_video2()/avcodec_encode_audio2():
   Use avcodec_send_frame() to feed input to the encoder, then use
   avcodec_receive_packet() to receive encoded packets.
   Providing user-allocated buffers for avcodec_receive_packet() is not
   possible.
 - The new API does not handle subtitles yet.

 Mixing new and old function calls on the same AVCodecContext is not allowed,
 and will result in undefined behavior.

 Some codecs might require using the new API; using the old API will return
 an error when calling it.

 Identify the syntax and semantics of the bitstream.
 The principle is roughly:
 Two decoders with the same ID can decode the same streams.
 Two encoders with the same ID can encode compatible streams.
 There may be slight deviations from the principle due to implementation
 details.

 If you add a codec ID to this list, add it so that
 1. no value of an existing codec ID changes (that would break ABI),
 2. it is as close as possible to similar codecs

 After adding new codec IDs, do not forget to add an entry to the codec
 descriptor list and bump libavcodec minor version.

 For planar audio, each channel has a separate data pointer, and
 linesize[0] contains the size of each channel buffer.
 For packed audio, there is just one data pointer, and linesize[0]
 contains the total size of the buffer for all channels.

 extended_data must be used in order to access all channels.

 For audio, only linesize[0] may be set. For planar audio, each channel
 plane must be the same size.

 For video the linesizes should be multiples of the CPUs alignment
 preference, this is 16 or 32 for modern desktop CPUs.
 Some code requires such alignment other code can be slower without
 correct alignment, for yet other it makes no difference.

 @note The linesize may be larger than the size of usable data -- there
 may be extra padding present for performance reasons.

 see avcodec_align_dimensions2(). Some filters and swscale can read
 up to 16 bytes beyond the planes, if these filters are to be used,
 then 16 extra bytes must be allocated.

 MUST be set to NULL.

</member>
        <member name="T:libffmpeg.AVFrame">
 This structure describes decoded (raw) audio or video data.

 AVFrame must be allocated using av_frame_alloc(). Note that this only
 allocates the AVFrame itself, the buffers for the data must be managed
 through other means (see below).
 AVFrame must be freed with av_frame_free().

 AVFrame is typically allocated once and then reused multiple times to hold
 different data (e.g. a single AVFrame to hold frames received from a
 decoder). In such a case, av_frame_unref() will free any references held by
 the frame and reset it to its original clean state before it
 is reused again.

 The data described by an AVFrame is usually reference counted through the
 AVBuffer API. The underlying buffer references are stored in AVFrame.buf /
 AVFrame.extended_buf. An AVFrame is considered to be reference counted if at
 least one reference is set, i.e. if AVFrame.buf[0] != NULL. In such a case,
 every single data plane must be contained in one of the buffers in
 AVFrame.buf or AVFrame.extended_buf.
 There may be a single buffer for all the data, or one separate buffer for
 each plane, or anything in between.

 sizeof(AVFrame) is not a part of the public ABI, so new fields may be added
 to the end with a minor bump.
 Similarly fields that are marked as to be only accessed by
 av_opt_ptr() can be reordered. This allows 2 forks to add fields
 without breaking compatibility with each other.

 Fields can be accessed through AVOptions, the name string used, matches the
 C structure field name for fields accessible through AVOptions. The AVClass
 for AVFrame can be obtained from avcodec_get_frame_class()

 AVBufferPool is an API for a lock-free thread-safe pool of AVBuffers.

 Frequently allocating and freeing large buffers may be slow. AVBufferPool is
 meant to solve this in cases when the caller needs a set of buffers of the
 same size (the most obvious use case being buffers for raw video or audio
 frames).

 At the beginning, the user must call av_buffer_pool_init() to create the
 buffer pool. Then whenever a buffer is needed, call av_buffer_pool_get() to
 get a reference to a new buffer, similar to av_buffer_alloc(). This new
 reference works in all aspects the same way as the one created by
 av_buffer_alloc(). However, when the last reference to this buffer is
 unreferenced, it is returned to the pool instead of being freed and will be
 reused for subsequent av_buffer_pool_get() calls.

 When the caller is done with the pool and no longer needs to allocate any new
 buffers, av_buffer_pool_uninit() must be called to mark the pool as freeable.
 Once all the buffers are released, it will automatically be freed.

 Allocating and releasing buffers with this API is thread-safe as long as
 either the default alloc callback is used, or the user-supplied one is
 thread-safe.

refcounted data buffer API

 @defgroup lavu_buffer AVBuffer
 @ingroup lavu_data

 @{
 AVBuffer is an API for reference-counted data buffers.

 There are two core objects in this API -- AVBuffer and AVBufferRef. AVBuffer
 represents the data buffer itself; it is opaque and not meant to be accessed
 by the caller directly, but only through AVBufferRef. However, the caller may
 e.g. compare two AVBuffer pointers to check whether two different references
 are describing the same data buffer. AVBufferRef represents a single
 reference to an AVBuffer and it is the object that may be manipulated by the
 caller directly.

 There are two functions provided for creating a new AVBuffer with a single
 reference -- av_buffer_alloc() to just allocate a new buffer, and
 av_buffer_create() to wrap an existing array in an AVBuffer. From an existing
 reference, additional references may be created with av_buffer_ref().
 Use av_buffer_unref() to free a reference (this will automatically free the
 data once all the references are freed).

 The convention throughout this API and the rest of FFmpeg is such that the
 buffer is considered writable if there exists only one reference to it (and
 it has not been marked as read-only). The av_buffer_is_writable() function is
 provided to check whether this is true and av_buffer_make_writable() will
 automatically create a new writable buffer when necessary.
 Of course nothing prevents the calling code from violating this convention,
 however that is safe only when all the existing references are under its
 control.

 @note Referencing and unreferencing the buffers is thread-safe and thus
 may be done from multiple threads simultaneously without any need for
 additional locking.

 @note Two different references to the same buffer can point to different
 parts of the buffer (i.e. their AVBufferRef.data will not be equal).

A reference counted buffer type. It is opaque and is meant to be used through

 Audio sample formats

 - The data described by the sample format is always in native-endian order.
   Sample values can be expressed by native C types, hence the lack of a signed
   24-bit sample format even though it is a common raw audio data format.

 - The floating-point formats are based on full volume being in the range
   [-1.0, 1.0]. Any values outside this range are beyond full volume level.

 - The data layout as used in av_samples_fill_arrays() and elsewhere in FFmpeg
   (such as AVFrame in libavcodec) is as follows:

 @par
 For planar sample formats, each audio channel is in a separate data plane,
 and linesize is the buffer size, in bytes, for a single plane. All data
 planes must be the same size. For packed sample formats, only the first data
 plane is used, and samples for each channel are interleaved. In this case,
 linesize is the buffer size, in bytes, for the 1 plane.



Return the name of sample_fmt, or NULL if sample_fmt is not
recognized.


Return a sample format corresponding to name, or AV_SAMPLE_FMT_NONE
on error.


 * Get the packed alternative form of the given sample format.
 *
 * If the passed sample_fmt is already in packed format, the format returned is

 * the same as the input.
 *
 * @return  the planar alternative form of the given sample format or
            AV_SAMPLE_FMT_NONE on error.

 Utilities for manipulating memory.

 FFmpeg has several applications of memory that are not required of a typical
 program. For example, the computing-heavy components like video decoding and
 encoding can be sped up significantly through the use of aligned memory.

 However, for each of FFmpeg's applications of memory, there might not be a
 recognized or standardized API for that specific use. Memory alignment, for
 instance, varies wildly depending on operating systems, architectures, and
 compilers. Hence, this component of @ref libavutil is created to make
 dealing with memory consistently possible on all platforms.

a UCS-4 encoded Unicode character that is to be converted to UTF-16. If
val is given as a function it is executed only once.
@param tmp is a temporary variable and should be of type uint16_t. It
represents an intermediate value during conversion that is to be

 @section ffmpeg_intro Introduction

 This document describes the usage of the different libraries
 provided by FFmpeg.

 @li @ref libavc "libavcodec" encoding/decoding library
 @li @ref lavfi "libavfilter" graph-based frame editing library
 @li @ref libavf "libavformat" I/O and muxing/demuxing library
 @li @ref lavd "libavdevice" special devices muxing/demuxing library
 @li @ref lavu "libavutil" common utility library
 @li @ref lswr "libswresample" audio resampling, format conversion and mixing
 @li @ref lpp  "libpostproc" post processing library
 @li @ref libsws "libswscale" color conversion and scaling library

 @section ffmpeg_versioning Versioning and compatibility

 Each of the FFmpeg libraries contains a version.h header, which defines a
 major, minor and micro version number with the
 <em>LIBRARYNAME_VERSION_{MAJOR,MINOR,MICRO}</em> macros. The major version
 number is incremented with backward incompatible changes - e.g. removing
 parts of the public API, reordering public struct members, etc. The minor
 version number is incremented for backward compatible API changes or major
 new features - e.g. adding a new public function or a new decoder. The micro
 version number is incremented for smaller changes that a calling program
 might still want to check for - e.g. changing behavior in a previously
 unspecified situation.

 FFmpeg guarantees backward API and ABI compatibility for each library as long
 as its major version number is unchanged. This means that no public symbols
 will be removed or renamed. Types and names of the public struct members and
 values of public macros and enums will remain the same (unless they were
 explicitly declared as not part of the public API). Documented behavior will
 not change.

 In other words, any correct program that works with a given FFmpeg snapshot
 should work just as well without any changes with any later snapshot with the
 same major versions. This applies to both rebuilding the program against new
 FFmpeg versions or to replacing the dynamic FFmpeg libraries that a program
 links against.

 However, new public symbols may be added and new members may be appended to
 public structs whose size is not part of public ABI (most public structs in
 FFmpeg). New macros and enum values may be added. Behavior in undocumented
 situations may change slightly (and be documented). All those are accompanied
 by an entry in doc/APIchanges and incrementing either the minor or micro
 version number.

 @defgroup lavu libavutil
 Common code shared across all FFmpeg libraries.

 @note
 libavutil is designed to be modular. In most cases, in order to use the
 functions provided by one component of libavutil you must explicitly include
 the specific header containing that feature. If you are only using
 media-related components, you could simply include libavutil/avutil.h, which
 brings in most of the "core" components.
